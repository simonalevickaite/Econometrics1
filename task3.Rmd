Wikipedia says, that R is a programming language and software environment for statistical computing and graphics supported by the R Foundation for Statistical Computing.
But R is not just about serious things like model inference and prediction intervals and big analytics. Sometimes, R lets its hair down and just does weird and wonderful things because ... well just because.
For example:
Lets use cowsay:
```{r}
install.packages("cowsay")

```
```{r}
library ("cowsay")
say ("catfact", "cat")

```
And now we got a cat!

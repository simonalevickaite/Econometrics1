Wikipedia says, that R is a programming language and software environment for statistical computing and graphics supported by the R Foundation for Statistical Computing.
But R is not just about serious things like model inference and prediction intervals and big analytics. Sometimes, R lets its hair down and just does weird and wonderful things because ... well just because.
For example, lets create a cat.
```{r}
library("cowsay")
say("catfact", "cat")
```
And now we got a cat!

Lets generate 10000 first and second players attempts and count the winnings of first player
```{r}
n <- 100000
pl1 <- replicate(n, sum(sample(1:6, 3, replace=TRUE)))
pl2 <- replicate(n, sum(sample(1:6, 2, replace=TRUE)))
sum(pl1 > pl2)
```
Lets deduct attempts where first and second players got the same number of points
```{r}
n2 <- n-sum(pl1 == pl2)
```
Lets find the first player's winning probability
```{r}
sum(pl1 > pl2)/n2
```

Lets count the probability of having a positive balance after 100 attempts
```{r}
n <- 100000
balance <- replicate(n, sum(sample(c(12, -10), 100, replace=TRUE)))
mean(balance>0)
```
Lets count the 95 % confidence interval of balance
```{r}
quantile(balance, 0.025) #lower
quantile(balance, 0.975) #top
```
Lets create the plot of balance density
```{r}
plot(density(balance), main="Density of balance", lwd = 2, col = 10)
grid()
```
